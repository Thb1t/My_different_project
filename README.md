# Personal Projects (AI, Physics, Experimental)

This repository gathers several personal projects I've been building since 2023. Some are AI-focused, others are related to realistic physics simulation or exploratory ideas.

## 🔧 Neural Network in C (from scratch and any help)

- Fully manual implementation of a neural network in C.
- No external libraries: forward, backpropagation, activation functions all coded low-level exepted the display with Allegro.
- Started in 2023 as a way to deeply understand the fundamentals.

## 🐍📲 Snake – Deep Q-Learning (Python)

- Agent trained to play Snake using **Deep Q-Learning**.
- Reinforcement learning method where a neural network approximates the Q-value function to help an agent learn optimal actions through trial and error.
- Libraries : Tensorflow, Matplotlib and Numpy.
- Started in 2023 but not conclusive.

---

## 🐍🧬 Snake – Genetic Algorithm

- Second approach to the Snake game using **evolutionary algorithms**.
- Populations of neural nets evolve through selection, crossover, and mutation.
- Libraries : Neat, Matplotlib and Numpy.
- Start in 2023 with very good results.

## 🎨 Convolutional GAN – Image Generation

- **Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network** trained to generate images from noise.
- Libraries : Torch, Matplotlib and Numpy.
- Start in 2023 and trained on Cat pictures, good results but very long to train.

## 🧪 Spontaneous Membrane Formation (experiment)

- Attempt to simulate spontaneous emergence of membrane-like structures.
- Based on simple rules and spatial dynamics (attractions and repultions).
- Experimental, incomplete — more of a conceptual probe than a finished model.

---

## 🧮 Realistic Physics Modeling (course → code)

- Code snippets to simulate physical phenomena covered in class.
- Examples: gravitation, repultions, collision.
- Used Python and C to bring theoretical equations to life in visual form.

---

## 🧱 Empty Interface Template for Future Projects

- Minimal frontend/backend setup to host upcoming AI projects.
- No real business logic yet — just a structured base to build on.
- Designed to avoid repeating boilerplate setup later.
